/*
 * Recursively tiling a 2^n x 2^n chessboard with one piece removed.
 * There are four types of tiles:  
 	+--+		   +--+			+--+--+		+--+--+
 	|X |		   |X |        	|X |  |     |X |  |
 	+--+--+		+--+--+			+--+--+		+--+--+
	|  |  |     |  |  |		   	   |  |     |  |
	+--+--+     +--+--+            +--+     +--+

	Type 1		Type 2			Type 3		Type 4

Each referenced as being at location denoted in the X.
Note that for Type i, the missing piece of this tile, 
compared to a full 2x2 square, is quadrant i.

ChessBoard is 1..2^n x 1..2^n, with (1,1) in the top-left.
